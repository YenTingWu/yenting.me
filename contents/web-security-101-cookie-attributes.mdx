## Cookies attributes

### Secure

The `Secure` attribute tells the browser to only send the cookie if the request is being set over a secure channel such as **HTTPS.** This will help protect the cookie from being passed in unencrypted requests.

<Table
  colTitles={['Secure: true', 'Secure: false']}
  rowTitles={[
    'Will a browser send the cookie if the request url is start with http?',
  ]}
  rows={[['no', 'yes']]}
/>

### httpOnly

The `httpOnly` attribute is used to help prevent attacks such as session leakage, since it does not allow the cookie to be accessed via a client-side script such as JavaScript.

<Table
  colTitles={['httpOnly: true', 'httpOnly: false']}
  rowTitles={['Can a user assess the cookie with document.cookie?']}
  rows={[['no', 'yes']]}
/>

### SameSite

The `SameSite` attribute can be used to assert whether a cookie should be sent along with cross-site requests. This feature allows the server to mitigate the risk of cross-origin information leakage. It is used to as a risk reduction strategy to prevent CSRF attacks.

- **SameSite=None** - default, always send cookies
- **SameSite=Lax** - withhold cookies on sub-resource requests originating from other site, allow them on top-level requests
- **SameSite=Strict** - only send cookies if the request originates from the website that set the cookie (exact same)

`Set-Cookie: key=value; Secure; HttpOnly; Path=/; SameSite=Lax`

<Table
  colTitles={['SameSite: Strict', 'SameSite: Lax', 'SameSite: None']}
  rowTitles={[
    'If the cookie set by https://yenting.me, can https://attacker.com access the cooke?',
    'If the cookie set by https://yenting.me, can https://blog.yenting.me access the cooke?',
    'If the cookie set by https://yenting.me, can https://yenting.me/posts access the cooke?',
    'If the cookie set by https://yenting.me, can https://yenting.me access the cooke?',
  ]}
  rows={[
    ['No', 'No', 'Yes'],
    ['No', 'Yes', 'Yes'],
    ['No', 'Yes', 'Yes'],
    ['Yes', 'Yes', 'Yes'],
  ]}
/>
