## XSS (cross-site scripting)

[Game](https://xss-game.appspot.com/)

XSS attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites.

- Code injection is caused when untrusted user data unexpectedly becomes code
- In XSS, the unexpected code is Javascript in an HTML document
- In SQL injection, the unexpected code is extra SQL commands included a SQL query string.

If successful, attacker gains the ability to do anything the target can do through their browser

- Can view/exfiltrate their cookies
- Can send any HTTP request to the site. with the userâ€™s cookies

### Reflected vs. Stored XSS

- In **reflected XSS,** the attack code is placed into the HTTP request itself
  - Attacker goal: find a URL that you can make target visit that includes your attack code
  - Limitation: Attack code must be added to the URL path or query parameters
- In **stored XSS,** the attack code is persisted into the database
  - Attacker goal: Use **any means** to get attack code into the database
  - Once there, server includes it in all pages sent to clients
