## CSRF (cross-site resource forgery)

Attacker which forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web app in which they’re currently authenticated

- Normal users: CSRF attack can force user to perform requests like transferring funds, changing email address, etc.
- Admin users: CSRF attack can force admins to add new admin user, or in the worst case, run commands directly on the server

Effective even when attacker can’t read the HTTP response
