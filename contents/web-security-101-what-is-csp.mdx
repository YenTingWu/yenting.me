## Origin

Web content’s **origin** is defined by the scheme (protocol), hostname (domain), and port of the URL used to access it.

## Same-origin policy

The same-origin policy is a critical security mechanism that restricts how a document or script loaded by one origin can interact with a resource from another origin.

`http://store.company.com/dir/page.html`:

<Table
  colTitles={['Outcome', 'Reason']}
  rowTitles={[
    'http://store.company.com/dir2/other.html',
    'http://store.company.com/dir/inner/another.html',
    'https://store.company.com/page.html',
    'http://store.company.com:81/dir/page.html',
    'http://news.company.com/dir/page.html',
  ]}
  rows={[
    ['Same origin', 'Only the path'],
    ['Same origin', 'Only the path'],
    ['Failure', 'Different protocol'],
    ['Failure', 'Different port (http:// is port 80 by default)'],
    ['Failure', 'Different host'],
  ]}

## CSP (Content Secure Policy)

Content Security Policy is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including XXS and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft, to site defacement, to malware distribution.

Browsers that don't support it still work with servers that implement it, and vice versa: browsers that don't support CSP ignore it, functioning as usual, defaulting to the standard same-origin policy for web content. If the site doesn't offer the CSP header, browsers likewise use the standard [same-origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy).

### To enable CSP

1. &lt;meta&gt; element can be used to configure a policy:

```html
<meta
  http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
  content="default-src 'self'; img-src https://*; child-src 'none';"
/>
```

1. Configure web servers to return the Content-Security-Policy HTTP header

### Example

1. all content to come from the site’s own origin

```yaml
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
```

2. content from trusted domain and all its subdomains

```yaml
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self' example.com *.example.com
```

3. images from any origin in their own content, but restrict audio or video media to trusted providers, and all scripts to a specific server

```yaml
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; img-src *; media-src example.org
	example.net; script-src userscripts.example.com
```
