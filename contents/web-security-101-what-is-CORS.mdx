## CORS

Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism for integrating applications. CORS defines a way for client web applications that are loaded in one domain to interact with resources in a different domain.

### Why is cross-origin resource sharing important?

In the past, when internet technologies were still new, CSRF issues happened. These issues sent fake client requests from the victimâ€™s browser to another application.

To prevent such CSRF issues, all browsers now implement the same-origin policy.

**ðŸ˜±Â the same-origin policy is highly secure but inflexible for genuine use cases.**

Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is an extension of the same-origin policy. You need it for authorized resource sharing with external third parties.

- You need CORS when you want to pull data from external APIs that are public or authorized.
- You also need CORS if you want to allow authorized third-party access to your own server resources.

### How does cross-origin resource sharing work?

When you make a cross-origin request, this is the request-response process:

1. The browser adds an origin header to the request with information about the current origin's protocol, host, and port
2. The server checks the current origin header and responds with the requested data and an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header
3. The browser sees the access control request headers and shares the returned data with the client application

Alternatively, if the server doesnâ€™t want to allow cross-origin access, it responds with an error message.

### What are some CORS best practices?

- **Define appropriate access lists**
  Itâ€™s always best to grant access to individual domains using comma-separated lists. Avoid using wildcards unless you want to make the API public.
- **Avoid using null origin in your list**
  Some browsers send the valueÂ *null*Â in the request header for certain scenarios like file requests or requests from the local host.
