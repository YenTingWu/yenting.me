A Link Preview is a component that enhances links to an external website by showing a thumbnail of the website when the user hovers over the link. Its purpose is to give the user some context of their destination before they leave your website.

### Dark mode support

Note: For this to work, the external site has to use a dark mode solution that **defaults** to the users [`prefers-color-scheme`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) system preference.

_Sorry this website doesn't support dark mode yet._ ðŸ™ˆ
