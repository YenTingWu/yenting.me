  "self-statement": "My name is YenTing Wu, a self-taught software engineer and a creator. My passion for being a software engineer lies in coming up with brilliant ideas with my colleges and enabling them. I take good care about experience, design and communication. \nI am also an open-source collaborator, mainly contribute to React community. I currently work with Chakra UI team to build the doc site and maintain DevRel. I love to collaborate with people coming from different backgrounds but having the same goal - Building a better community.\n Outside of programming, I love river trekking, biking in summer and exploring wild hot spring in winter. Nature always inspires me."
